### Sorting Algorithms in STL

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are extensively used in various applications. C++ STL provide couple of useful sorting functions. Let's take a look at some of them:

#### `sort()`:

*   `sort()` is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts elements in a range into ascending order (by default) or according to a specified comparison function.
    
*   **Time Complexity**: The average time complexity of `sort()` is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the range.
    
*   The underlying sorting algorithm used by `sort()` in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is typically an implementation of the introsort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines three different algorithms: quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort.
    
*   **Usage**:
    
    ```cpp
    sort(start_iterator, end_iterator, comparison_function);
    ```
        
    
    *   `start_iterator`: Iterator pointing to the beginning of the range.
    *   `end_iterator`: Iterator pointing to the end of the range (one past the last element).
    *   `comparison_function`: Optional function or lambda to specify custom sorting criteria.
*   **Example**:
    
    ```cpp
    vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());  // Sorts vec in non-decreasing order
    ```
        
    

Let's quickly take a look at some other less frequently used sorting functions provided by STL:

#### `stable_sort()`:

*   `stable_sort()` is similar to `sort()`, but it ensures that the relative order of equal elements remains unchanged after sorting.
    
*   Similar to `sort()`, O(n log n) time complexity.
    
*   **Usage**:
    ```cpp
    stable_sort(start_iterator, end_iterator, comparison_function);
    ```
        
    
*   **Example**:
    
    ```cpp
    vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
    stable_sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());  // Sorts vec in ascending order
    ```
        
    

#### `partial_sort()`:

*   `partial_sort()` partially sorts the range such that the smallest `k` elements are sorted in ascending order.
    
*   **Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of elements to sort.
    
*   **Usage**:
    
    ```cpp
    partial_sort(start_iterator, middle_iterator, end_iterator, comparison_function);
    ```
    
*   **Example**:
    ```cpp
    vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
    partial_sort(vec.begin(), vec.begin() + 3, vec.end());  // Sorts the smallest 3 elements
    ```    
    

#### `nth_element()`:

*   `nth_element()` rearranges the elements such that the element at the nth position is in its correct sorted position, and all elements before it are less than or equal to it, while all elements after it are greater than or equal to it.
    
*   **Complexity**: O(n) on average.
    
*   **Usage**:
    ```cpp
    nth_element(start_iterator, nth_iterator, end_iterator, comparison_function);
     ```   
    
*   **Example**:
    ```cpp
    vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
    nth_element(vec.begin(), vec.begin() + 2, vec.end());  // Places the 3rd smallest element in its correct position
     ```
