### Operations on Vector - Part II

Let's go through some more common vector operations/algorithms in C++.

*   **Getting sum/prefix sum of vector:**
    *   Getting sum of elements of a vector: Using `accumulate()`:

    ```cpp
      int sum = accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0); // sum = 18, the sum of elements with initial value 0
    
      // we can even perform any binary operation with accumulate(), not just addition.
      int mul(int x, int y) { // custom multiplication function
       return x * y;
      }
      int product = accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 1, mul); 
      // product = -420. after range, 1 is initial value of product and 
      // mul is our custom binary operation function (multiplication in this case).
    ```
    

*   Few things to note about `accumulate()` function:
    
    *   It returns the result of accumulating all the values in the given range with specified initial value
    *   The default operation is to add the elements up, but a different operation can be specified (as we can seen above).
    *   The time complexity is _linear_ in size.
*   **Getting partial sum(prefix sum) of elements of a vector:** Using `partial_sum()`:
    
    ```cpp
      // C++ program to demonstrate the use of std::partial_sum function
        #include <bits/stdc++.h>
        using namespace std;

        int main() {
            vector<int> vec = {5, 10, 15};
            vector<int> res(vec.size());
        
            // Defining range as the whole array
            auto first = vec.begin();
            auto last = vec.end();
        
            // Use partial_sum to calculate the cumulative sum of elements
            partial_sum(first, last, res.begin());

            for (int val : res)
                cout << val << " ";
            return 0;
        }

      ```

    *   Output: `5 15 30`
    

*   Few things to note about `partial_sum()` function:
    *   This function assigns a partial sum of the corresponding elements of a vector to every position of the second array.
    *   The default operation is to add the elements up, but similar to `accumulate()` function, a different operation can be specified (as we can seen above).
    *   Its time complexity is also _linear_ in size.
